# Cartoon-Making

Personally I'm very fond of cartoons growing up watching cartoons and animes like Naruto, Dragon-Ball Z, Doreamon, Shinchan(personal mood booster ;)) and a lot more.

So here in this repo you will find a file named as "Cartoonizer.py" which can help you make your photos or any photo of yours like to look like a cartoon or to be specific
it will make your photo a photo that is made by an artist.

## How to use it:

It is very simple just download that "Cartoonizer.py" file open it with your personal favourite IDE or you can use Shell (if you are a pro like me 😁) and just run it
you have to enter your correct name of file that's the most important thing I have realized working on this project a minor spelling mistake and compiler shows error

## Pre-requsites:

- You must have **Python >= 3.5** installed on your PC or mac
- **OpenCV** installed on your machine
    - if you don't know how to install it just write
      **pip install openCV** in your *Bash* or *Terminal* and you are good to go :-)
- Study about _openCV_ and _Python Applications_  😋

## Credits:

Kudos to all the `OpenCV` team members :)
